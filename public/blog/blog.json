Basically, I would have to run this thing through a translator to provide this and save the JSON file. Gotta be an easier way though.",

Gonna look more into this. But for right now I should probably reign it in. I've made a dynamic dropdown and began setting up for that kind of support but don't have the energy to run this thing through an API. Gonna start with the code I have for 1:18 though. If I wanted to do it without an API I could probably run this through google translate. But still, awful lot of work wehn I could just do it automated in the start.

      "Got SCSS set up, took it off of mapping everything so that it doesn't take up as much space. I don't use those maps anyway. I'm wondering if my file architecture is right here. Some people put them all in a stylesheet and I thought that I wasn't a fan of that becuase it made it hard to find your file in styles and at the component level. Tomorrow first order of business should probably be to toggle that setting and change where they all route to and make it route to its own style sheet. It doesn't really matter where it goes, after all, as long as it all pulls in the data. My main reasoning for this is that it is difficult to have components like Navbar.js right between Navbar.css and Navbar.scss. I keep clicking the wrong one and if I keep doing that something is going to get overridden and made more difficult in the future.",
      "Next, I need to set some standards pretty quickly. Now that I have Sass, I can offload some of those bloated components I created and just make them run on scss with mixins. Like the title component, subtitle - all sass would fix that.",
      "But really I'm putting off doing a node server. But I need a node server. I could take one of my old ones and refactor the code for it. Truthfully, I'd like a fresh start now that I've had some time to think about architecture. My blog template right now requires a place for tags. And I will have to edit this whole thing. I don't want to scrub away all of the truth of my experience here though. I have the luxury of knowing that devs are made through trial and error and failure. That doing things wrong is sometimes more valuable than doing things right. If you've had to fix it - you've found out intimately how it's broken. That the best part of this job is getting done with doing something really hard and getting to be proud of it and later avoiding that mistake."

      "Starting setup of a backend in node to get back into the swing of it. Actually have written about as much in node as I have React, though somewhat less recently. Thing is I'll get done with the setup but then have to implement cors and haven't been able to host it. React Native doesn't play so nice with localhost the last time I checked. Could be wrong about that. Could be I was thrashing last time I tried and made a rookie mistake. Either way I got hosting so I can do CORs and a Native App too.",
      "Could use it for my D and D notes - they are becoming increasingly complex as the gang has aquired a new bar that we now have to manage, stock and decorate. Plus, the one I am using is kind of clunky. D&D beyond is cool but it sure would be nice to be able to see the bar finances for this module. Plus if there's one thing devs love - it's D&D. I weas a bit embarrassed on that previous project when it wasn't built out fully and there's a decent API that would work for it already, which would reduce the load of data I have to store here.",
      "Either way, I got it started and set up a bit of middleware for logging. Made sure to take off that header that says it's a node server. I mean, you'll know that from this blog entry. But still, best practice, you know. I was really really tempted to call it curlybooty. Like really really tempted. I may change the name later. Not sure I want people to see that on github though. Or maybe I do. Could be a conversation starter. Oh well, I can call it booty to myself either way. There are ruder words than that floating around."

      "Got the basic architecture of the blog posts set up now, feeling pretty good about that. It was a little daunting to try and remember how to use Mongo. I'll admit there's a lot of gaps in my knowledge about it. I just know I am going to utterly wreck this database before I am through. I'm thinking about saving json files to a separate repo for backup as part of the build process as I go. Will do that once I get that set up. For right now, I'm backing up here. I remember versioning being very tricky and having scrap and wipe becuase I was so novice at versioning. I would like to avoid that this time around, but I'm a pragmatist. If I can break it, I will break it. Maybe that is what starts to turn you from a rookie into a somewhat respectable coder. Understanding that and planning for it. Redundancies and such. I am still very terrified of what happens when I try to put this up live.",
      "But for right now I'm going to go ahead and celebrate this little win. I set up the boilerplate yesterday - stuff like a message saying what it would do, just like they taught in bootcamp and then today made the mongoose models, set up the db locally, and got it to connect through routing. It does the CRUD stuff and actually had minimal problems in setting up. Typo here and there but overall was very easy for me to go in and fix when the time came. Definitely felt easier than any times before. When I was just learning, it took me an entire week to do what I was able to do in a few hours. Even less time because I spent an hour on the Legion of Code standup meeting (a little something I cooked up to keep myself and my coding/graphic design/ux buddies working on stuff and having deadlines.) Also spent another hour with Molly talking about her design goals specifically and getting a little insight into photoshop. Crazy how quickly she can make really cool looking art. Really shows how much time and effort she has put into it - knows all of the shortcuts and some things I never would have dreamed of thinking of. She's gonna make the big bucks soon - I just know it.",

      "Basement flooded yesterday around 4. Have been moving things around and dealing with the strain of moving everything around, vacuuming everything, digging trenches for the water and trying ot get my computer set up on the other side of the house that isn't flooding. I'm lucky that I know what to do in this situation since I just went through this two months ago, but it is a little frustrating in that I only just put some of that stuff back a week or two ago only to have to move it all across the floor at once. Still, CJ can help this time since his back is back to normal, so this has made the process immensely easier. I have to admit, my first reaction was to panic but I feel alarmingly in control.",
      "That said, isn't balance the thing always? I remember thinking as I looked through these entries before taht I wasn't taking enough time to step away before returning to the problem. I was being frantic and trying to do a lot very quickly. Sometimes this works and sometimes this results in flailing. Luckily, while I was dealing with all of the flooding nightmare I was able to think through my problem by the time I got the computer set up and get all my endpoints postman tested, which was nice. I know in its current format I don't like how the logout is set up but I also know that I still have another day of work to get this part to a good place and then I have to set up the interface on the other end as well. So maybe I can be nitpicky later. MVP is mother of viable progress. (*BTW if you are new to programming it is actually Minimum Viable Product - but I was trying to wax poetic about the concept here.*)",
      "Anyway, I don't want to stay here all night, I still have to move a bunch of books and furniture as the carpet people come out tomorrow to air things out. Unfortunately the flood preparation is very important. But I will at least be able to work from the room I have set up. It's been kind of our lab/workshop for art things, and I've spent some time fixing it up not too long ago, so it makes a fair sanctuary from the flood nightmare in which I can work. So I will be on tomorrow but wanted to write a bit for myself at least and fix this update I didn't have a chance to before I had to move the electronics unexpectedly."

I just had a fun interview. Interviews have been fun - how amazing is that?! I had always dreamed of getting to a point with something where my enthusiasm would be rewarded or embraced, but that just doesn't happen as a bill collector. Also, enthusiasm as a bill collector usually ended up souring the rest of your life in some way. I stayed there for so long because I wanted to be near the data or writing in a spreadsheet. I weirdly liked spreadsheets. It took me far too long to learn that I really just liked demanding that computers do what I want them to.",

I didn't restrain myself and kind of said just what I wanted to - that often scares people away but more and more I'm wondering if it is worth trying to pretend to be someone I'm not. I mean, it's not - is it? That's like living to work instead of working to live. I don't want that life. But I know devs. Devs are weird. Like me. And if we stopped being strange I think it would be a very sad place indeed. So to hell with it, I never liked the kind of jobs where you have to pretend you're looking straight in their eyes and worry about the kind of handshake you have or the cost of your pants or shoes. All banal trivialities - I just want to go somewhere I can do what I love.",

The reason I'm making sure to write this down: something my interviewer said about REST strategies. Made me think that I need to write a note to myself that I need to change the setup of the blog structure. Maybe only on the front end. Obfuscate it a little - route in their browser nicely with their username instead of blogId. Maybe keep it blog/:blogId back here.",

So now we have a gaping hole with pipe sticking out of it three feet deep. When their children fall in that hole I'm sure it will be a consolation to their parents that this is to prevent some water running down the street a ways. We, of course, never get any water in Washington State in the Seattle Metro Area. Dry as a bone, that's what we're known for! Poor workers, they put their whole ass into that repair and are worried that the trench that they so nicely graded and leveled will be ruined by rain before they can return to it.
